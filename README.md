# IMDB_Movie_Naive_Bayes
The following steps are taken while building the model
  1.Data Loading
  2.Understanding data 
  3.Data Cleaning 
  4.Data Vectorization
  5.Data Splitting 
  6.Training Model with Naive Bayes
  7.Evaluating Accuracy, Recall, Precision , F1 Score
  8.Confusion Matrix
  9.Saving the trained model as .pkl file
  10.Loading the trained Naive Bayes model and the fitted TF-IDF vectorizer 
  11.Taking input sentence from User
  12.Cleaning the user input
  13.Transforming the cleaned user input into a numerical feature vector using the loaded tfidf_vectorizer
  14.Predict Sentiment 
Model Accuracy 0.8694

The whole task has been done in Google Collab platform. I am attaching the ipynb file along with the py file . And it's recommended to view it on a google collab notebook.
